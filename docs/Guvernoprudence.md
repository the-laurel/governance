# Guvernoprudence

From the principle of guvernoprudence [Principle 12 (Guvernoprudence)](https://github.com/the-laurel/governance/blob/main/docs/EthicsOfBlockchainGovernance.md), we deduce:

1. Governance is a type of judgment (or the other way around: judging is a type of governance). Legal principles can be applied to governance.
1. The previous consensus can be used for future consensus. For example consensus on English words and their links to concepts. We will use the words and the meanings from [WordNet](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn) and, for extended meanings, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)
1. Consensus on words and concepts should be next-to-impossible to overturn. Concepts are timeless. Pre-established consensus on the link between a concept and the word that signifies it should be timeless. Since this consensus existed before the present voters' lives, people who are not alive today are entitled to vote on "change of meaning" proposals. And that is impossible. As an alternative: local (restricted to a community) consensus on temporary slang can be achieved. Slang should not be used in governing public blockchains.
1. A searchable index of all previous governance decisions should be maintained.
1. A dictionary of usual terms and synonyms that provide a "cache of consensus" should be also maintained and recommended for use in governance proposals.
