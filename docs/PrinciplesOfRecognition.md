# Principles Of Recognition

The recognition of talent and effort is a process that deserves analysis standardization. We can begin by listing some desired features:

- it has to contain precise encoding of quality and quantity
- grading is done against a background that can be local or global. If local grading is used, it has to contain its own global grade. Examples:
  - for this exam, this student obtained a score of 5th out of a class of 18, and this class is on the 234th place out of 3057 such classes in the nation, and this is the 2nd nation in the world in K-12 education
  - this old woman donated 2 coins out of the only 3 coins that she owns
- donating or volunteering anonymously is less virtuous than donating with an abundance of details of recognition
- financial tracing of provenance of funds should be part of the recognition information
- equal access to recognition information about all participants is an implementation of the principle of equality of chance and fairness
- strong identity is a must
