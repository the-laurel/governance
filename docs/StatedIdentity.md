# Stated Identity

## Stated Identity: Definition
The stated identity is the totality of information about a digital actor that was not automatically generated but rather stated or transferred from external sources without proof.

A stated identity can take many forms:
- name, nickname, with/without emoticons
- descriptions
- image/icon/photo
- animation/video
- audio
- combinations of the above


## Types of Stated Identity
From the responsibility point of view, there are the following types of stated identity:
1. Untruthful
    1. Imitation of a truthful identity, but with intended falsities: impersonating the identity of an admin or moderator
    1. Injurious, harmful to the reader, to a third entity, or to the context of the use
    1. Evidently untruthful, without consequence: "NapoleonBonaparte999"
    1. Short-lived nicknamed
1. Truthful
    1. Anonymous
    1. Long-lived nicknamed
    1. (Truthfully) Classified: "JavaScripter42", "Seattler423"
    1. Civil
       1. partial: "Olaf254", "Sylvester34"
       1. complete: "Christian Tzurcanu32"
       1. proven

## Hierarchy of Completeness
This is the order that we consider (from lowest to highest):

1. anon
1. nickname
1. URL to icon
1. first name
1. middle name
1. last name
1. URL to photo
1. URL to proof of identity
1. completeness: which fields were provided


Each of the attributes of identity is followed by a unique number that ensures unicity of that identity on that particular dimension. Only the higher-order number is included when identity is displayed.
Example:
Identity: Christian Tzurcanu | 305

could be composed of:
1. anon | 537456032
2. first name: Christian | 21003423
3. last name: Tzurcanu | 305
4. completeness: [first_name, last_name]
