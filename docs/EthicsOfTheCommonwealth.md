# The Ethics of the Commonwealth

## Sources of Income for The Commonwealth
1. developer rewards for:
    1. contracts that were not source-invented by the deployer
    1. contracts that impose functional monopolies
1. donations
1. specific (rare) `burn` usecases
1. fees and user rewards for:
    1. cron transactions: when the cron transaction benefits the chain-wide community
    1. eventual transactions: for the same
1. staking

## Targets of Outcome (of Expenses)
1. innovative tech
1. essential infrastructure

Expenses should be proposed only after additional income is secured.

## Definitions
1. commonwealth: the account that holds the common wealth of the chain. Eg: community pool.
1. functional monopoly: the implementation of a standard that everybody has to agree to follow in order for a specific functionality to survive in a decentralized environment.
1. source-invented: you are source-inventor if you have ability to prove source code implementation as your own original idea. (Eg: by github repo)
1. `burn` usecases: situations where tokens need to be `burned` (in Ethereum ERC-20 standard: sent to address 0x00)
