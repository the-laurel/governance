# Consensual Role
A consensual role is a role that an individual assumes and is confirmed by the community. Or the community bestows on somebody and the individual accepts it.
This facet of identity, together with the [Stated Identity](https://github.com/the-laurel/governance/blob/main/docs/StatedIdentity.md), may be enough in most cases to determine the standing in general matters of governance. Particular standing is, however, defined in relation to specific proposals.
